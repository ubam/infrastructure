## A Few More Details (less fun)

Although the above list is true the 'how to' part may need a bit more explaining.  Let's be honest.  Every community has people in it.  And where people are, good and bad things happen.  To help keep the bad down and the good up, we apply the Ubuntu code of conduct to the language groups in the same way it's applied to any UBports group.  Here is the [code of conduct](https://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct). If you let nasty people stay nasty, the good folks will leave so use your comunity-minded discretion and the code of conduct to guide your decisions. 

Look for your replacement at all times.  You never know when you will get sick or busy so always keep looking for other good Language Captains in the growing group.  The ideal Language Captain will have many or all of the following qualities:

1. Strong in English
2. Excited about their own language
3. Engaged in the project
4. Helpful
5. Hard working
6. Engaged (regularly present, no random disappearances)

### How to handle Install support:

It depends on your group at the given moment, whether you want to help in the language group or move to a separate room. If there's already good discussion going on and @WelcomePlus is free, go there and support in your language. If there's busy talking everywhere, you can also use one of our UBlabs.
