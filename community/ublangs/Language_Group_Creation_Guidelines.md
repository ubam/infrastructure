# Translations Quickstart Guide

Do you know languages and want to help? Come and join the Ubuntu Touch Translators community, and make it possible to use Ubuntu in your own language.

This quick introduction will help you getting started and guide you. There is no need to install special tools and no previous technical knowledge is required. You'll be using [UBports Weblate translating tool](https://translate.ubports.com/).

## Minimum requirements to start translating

- **UBlangs captain:** contact and get in touch with your language captain in your local Telegram Supergroup, see link below
- **Spare time:** You decide how much you want to get involved - from some spare minutes to some hours a week
- **Be collaborative:** be keen to work collaboratively with translation teams
- **Internet:** a device with Internet connection
- **E-mail:** a stable e-mail address that you will use to register at UBports Weblate
- **Language knowledge:** English (source language for translations) and the language you are going to translate into. You can choose also another language in UBports Weblate settings page that may help you to understand the original source context

Before you start we recommend you to visit the [Weblate Docs page](https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/user/index.html#translators-guide), where you will find detailed guidelines to get started.
