# Group Creation Guidelines

*How to create, set up and administer UBports groups*

**Purpose:** With language groups taking off, followed by the invention of language captains, a level of chaos arose. Initially aiming to reduce chaos in the supergroup, the UBFR now started to face issues without the possibility to take action directly, namely by not being in a certain language group or being able to follow disputes in that language and, maybe more importantly, not having administrator rights in that language groups. Additionally, the group creation itself wasn't following any standards like naming conventions, thumbnail conventions, or even how to setup permissions and other group settings. This document aims to set a standard for all this and streamline the group creation process while ensuring quality, especially of non-mutable properties like the user name and thus invite link, but also ensure a hassle-free way of moderating the groups.

### Name and Thumbnail

Who can add members | *[TODO]*
Group stickers | (none? this could become a nuisance, even if seemingly fun or even fitting at first)

### Invite link

Public groups benefit from having an easily readable invite link, also allowing the use of a `@username` but for the group inside Telegram. Obviously, for "private" groups where people should not be able to randomly join but be invited individually setting up an easy way in is counterproductive.

Invite links and thus group usernames for general groups are proposed to follow a consitent pattern:    `@UBports_Purpose`  (the use of CamelCase is encouraged globally, even should the invite link have been created e.g. all lowercase)
Examples are the dedicated parents group `@UBports_Parents` and `@UBports_Cloudsters`.

Meanwhile, special groups can deviate from this pattern if they are important and big enough, like `@UBlangs` and, obviously, the main supergroup `@UBports`.
The same as above applies for potential channels, the only one currently is `@UBports_News`.

## Administration

In general, it could be seen highly benefinial if a group had at least two admins, for the occasion that one is unavailable for a longer period of time *(> 2 days)* when there is an urgent matter to take care of. Does an admin remain generally unavailable for an even longer period of time *(> 1 month)*, it should be taken into consideration to replace the absent admin with an active and trustworthy member of that group. Ideally, this should also happen in the consent of the previous admin to ensure a clean rotation without provoking a new conflict. The UBFR should maintain an overview of the admins of each group with their `@username` to easily contact. This should be kept fairly up to date, requiring the admins of the group to report changes and absent notices in a timely manner. Bigger groups *(> 200)* should generally have one UBFR member as additional admin.

*Note: Keeping Admin lists in sync with reality could be aided by a Telegram bot logging changes in group member information*
